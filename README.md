# Rule 110 Simulator

I love cellular automata like Conway’s Game of Life, they’re extremely interesting things to play with and think about. This is why I decided to write a Rule 110 simulator in Brainfuck. The program accepts zeroes and ones to set the initial state and it will calculate every next state when a newline is entered. Your Brainfuck interpreter will need to handle cell wrapping for this program to work.
